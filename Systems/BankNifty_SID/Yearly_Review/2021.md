For the calender year 2021, we reconciled the live trades along with the backtest trades.Since the start, several different versions ranging from At-The-Money to
Out-Of-The-Money to Minimum Premium have been tried. We had the dates as to which version was strated when along with the Entry Time, the Stop Loss Percentages etc.
Among all the versions, we reconciled only the Minimum Premium Logic. The reconciliation is saved in Strategy Testing/Short Options/BankNifty Weekly Short Options
on DropBox.The P/L and trades more or less matched with the Backtest trades.
