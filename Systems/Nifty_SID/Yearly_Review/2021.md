For the calender year 2021, we reconciled the live trades along with the backtest trades.Since the start, in the case of Nifty,Minimum Premium has been the only logic we've traded live. We had the dates as to which version was strated when along with the Entry Time, the Stop Loss Percentages etc.The reconciliation is saved in Strategy Testing/Short Options/Nifty Weekly Short Options on DropBox.The P/L and trades more or less matched with the Backtest trades.
